Autoscan integrates with Sonarr, Radarr, Lidarr and Google Drive to fetch changes in near real-time without relying on the file system. Wait, what happened to Plex Autoscan ? Well, Autoscan is a rewrite of the original Plex Autoscan written in the Go language. In addition, this rewrite introduces a more modular approach and should be easy to extend in the future. Comparison to Plex Autoscan \u00b6 A-Train , Autoscan's Google Drive integration, only supports Shared Drives and requires Service Account authentication. A-Train does not support RClone Crypt remotes. Autoscan does not rely on manual trash deletion when connected to Plex. Therefore, you should re-enable the Empty trash automatically after every scan setting in Plex. Autoscan also improves upon Plex Autoscan by adding the following features: Autoscan supports Plex music libraries. Autoscan adds additional support for Emby and Jellyfin. Autoscan can send scans to multiple Plex, Emby and Jellyfin servers. Installing autoscan \u00b6 Autoscan offers pre-compiled binaries for both Linux and MacOS for each official release. In addition, we also offer a Docker image ! Alternatively, you can build the Autoscan binary yourself. To build the autoscan CLI on your system, make sure: Your machine runs Linux, macOS or WSL2 You have Go installed (1.16 or later) Clone this repository and cd into it from the terminal Run go build -o autoscan ./cmd/autoscan from the terminal You should now have a binary with the name autoscan in the root directory of the project. To start autoscan, simply run ./autoscan . If you want autoscan to be globally available, move it to /bin or /usr/local/bin . If you need to debug certain Autoscan behaviour, either add the -v flag for debug mode or the -vv flag for trace mode to get even more details about internal behaviour. Overview \u00b6 Autoscan is split into three distinct modules: Triggers Processor Targets Rewriting paths \u00b6 Triggers, targets and the processor all live in different contexts. Some are used in Docker containers, others run on host OS, it can be a big mess! That's where rewrite rules come into play. They allow you to translate paths between a trigger's / target's perspective and the processor's perspective. Before you begin, make sure you understand how regular expressions work! \\ Make sure you know how capture groups work, as these are used for the to field. Triggers can receive paths from any source: A remote server, a Docker container and the local file system. The rewrite field can be defined for each individual trigger. This field can contain multiple rewriting rules. Therefore, each rule should have a - to indicate the next rule on the list. The from should be a regexp pattern describing the path from the trigger's perspective. The to should then convert this path into a path which is local to Autoscan. Targets work the other way around. They have to convert the path local to Autoscan to a path understood by the target, which can be a Docker container, remote server, etc. The from should be a regexp pattern describing the path from Autoscan's perspective. The to should then convert this path into a path which is local to the target. It is important that all three modules can have access to a file. When a trigger receives a scan, then the file should be available from both the processor and all targets. Simple example \u00b6 Sonarr running in a Docker container (same example works for Lidarr and Radarr) Autoscan running on the host OS (not in a container) Plex running in a Docker container The following config only defines rewrite paths, this should not be used directly! triggers : sonarr : - rewrite : # /tv contains folders with tv shows # This path is used within the Sonarr Docker container - from : /tv/ # /mnt/unionfs/Media/TV links to the same folder, though from the host OS # This folder is accessed by Autoscan to : /mnt/unionfs/Media/TV/ targets : plex : - rewrite : # Same folder as above, accessible by Autoscan. # Note how we strip the \"TV\" part, # as we want both Movies and TV. - from : /mnt/unionfs/Media/ # This path is used within the Plex Docker container to : /data/ Let's take a look at the journey of the path /tv/Westworld/Season 1/s01e01.mkv coming from Sonarr. Sonarr's path is translated to a path local to Autoscan. \\ /mnt/unionfs/Media/TV/Westworld/Season 1/s01e01.mkv The path is accessed by Autoscan to check whether it exists and adds it to the datastore. Autoscan's path is translated to a path local to Plex. \\ /data/TV/Season 1/s01e01.mkv This should be all that's needed to get you going. Good luck! Triggers \u00b6 Triggers are the 'input' of Autoscan. They translate incoming data into a common data format called the Scan. Autoscan currently supports the following triggers: A-Train : The official Google Drive trigger for Autoscan. \\ A-Train is available separately . Inotify: Listens for changes on the file system. \\ This should not be used on top of RClone mounts. \\ Bugs may still exist. Manual: When you want to scan a path manually. The -arrs: Lidarr, Sonarr and Radarr. \\ Webhook support for Lidarr, Sonarrr and Radarr. All triggers support: Trigger-wide priority: higher priorities are processed sooner. \\ Defaults to 0. RegExp-based rewriting rules: translate a path given by the trigger to a path on the local file system. \\ If the paths are identical between the trigger and the local file system, then the rewrite field should be ignored. A-Train \u00b6 Autoscan can monitor Google Drive through A-Train . A-Train is a stand-alone tool created by the Autoscan developers and is officially part of the Autoscan project. The A-Train trigger configuration is not required, as Autoscan automatically listens for A-Train requests. However, to configure global and drive-specific rewrite rules, you could add A-Train to your config: triggers : a-train : priority : 5 rewrite : # Global rewrites - from : ^/ to : /mnt/unionfs/ # Drives only need to be given when Drive-specific rewrites are used drives : - id : 0A1xxxxxxxxxUk9PVA # The ID of Shared Drive #1 rewrite : # Drive-specific rewrite (has priority over global rewrite) - from : ^/TV/ to : /mnt/unionfs/TV/ - id : 0A2xxxxxxxxxUk9PVA # The ID of Shared Drive #2 rewrite : # Drive-specific rewrite (has priority over global rewrite) - from : ^/Movies/ to : /mnt/unionfs/Movies/ Manual \u00b6 Note: You can visit /triggers/manual within a browser to manually submit requests Autoscan also supports a manual webhook for custom scripts or for software which is not supported by Autoscan directly. The manual endpoint is available at /triggers/manual . The manual endpoint accepts one or multiple directory paths as input and should be given one or multiple dir query parameters. Just like the other webhooks, the manual webhook is protected with basic authentication if the auth option is set in the config file of the user. URL template: POST /triggers/manual?dir=$path1&dir=$path2 The following curl command sends a request to Autoscan to scan the directories /test/one and /test/two : curl --request POST \\ --url 'http://localhost:3030/triggers/manual?dir=%2Ftest%2Fone&dir=%2Ftest%2Ftwo' \\ --header 'Authorization: Basic aGVsbG8gdGhlcmU6Z2VuZXJhbCBrZW5vYmk=' The -arrs \u00b6 If one wants to configure a HTTPTrigger with multiple distinct configurations, then these configurations MUST provide a field called Name which uniquely identifies the trigger. The name field is then used to create the route: /triggers/:name . The following -arrs are currently provided by Autoscan: Lidarr Radarr Sonarr Connecting the -arrs \u00b6 To add your webhook to Sonarr, Radarr or Lidarr, do: Open the settings page in Sonarr/Radarr/Lidarr Select the tab connect Click on the big plus sign Select webhook Use Autoscan as name (or whatever you prefer) Select On Import and On Upgrade Set the URL to Autoscan's URL and add /triggers/:name where name is the name set in the trigger's config. Optional: set username and password. The latest events \u00b6 Autoscan also supports the following events in the latest versions of Radarr and Sonarr: - Rename - On Movie Delete and On Series Delete - On Movie File Delete and On Episode File Delete We are not 100% sure whether these three events cover all the possible file system interactions. So for now, please do keep using Bernard or the Inotify trigger to fetch all scans. Configuration \u00b6 A snippet of the config.yml file showcasing what is possible. You can mix and match exactly the way you like: # Optionally, protect your webhooks with authentication authentication : username : hello there password : general kenobi # port for Autoscan webhooks to listen on port : 3030 triggers : # The manual trigger is always enabled, the config only adjusts its priority and the rewrite rules. manual : priority : 5 rewrite : - from : ^/Media/ to : /mnt/unionfs/Media/ a-train : priority : 5 rewrite : # Global rewrites - from : ^/ to : /mnt/unionfs/ # Drives only need to be given when Drive-specific rewrites are used drives : - id : 0A1xxxxxxxxxUk9PVA # The ID of Shared Drive #1 rewrite : # Drive-specific rewrite (has priority over global rewrite) - from : ^/TV/ to : /mnt/unionfs/TV/ inotify : - priority : 0 # filter with regular expressions include : - ^/mnt/unionfs/Media/ exclude : - '\\.(srt|pdf)$' # rewrite inotify path to unified filesystem rewrite : - from : ^/mnt/local/Media/ to : /mnt/unionfs/Media/ # local filesystem paths to monitor paths : - path : /mnt/local/Media lidarr : - name : lidarr # /triggers/lidarr priority : 1 radarr : - name : radarr # /triggers/radarr priority : 2 - name : radarr4k # /triggers/radarr4k priority : 5 sonarr : - name : sonarr-docker # /triggers/sonarr-docker priority : 2 # Rewrite the path from within the container # to your local filesystem. rewrite : - from : /tv/ to : /mnt/unionfs/Media/TV/ Processor \u00b6 Triggers pass the Scans they receive to the processor. The processor then saves the Scans to its datastore. The processor uses SQLite as its datastore, feel free to hack around! In a separate process, the processor selects Scans from the datastore. It will always group files belonging to the same folder together and it waits until all the files in that folder are older than the minimum-age , which defaults to 10 minutes. When all files are older than the minimum age, then the processor will call all the configured targets in parallel to request a folder scan. Anchor files \u00b6 To prevent the processor from calling targets when a remote mount is offline, you can define a list of so called anchor files . These anchor files do not have any special properties and often have no content. However, they can be used to check whether a file exists on the file system. If the file does not exist and you have not made any changes to the file, then it is certain that the remote mount must be offline or the software is having problems. When an anchor file is unavailable, the processor will halt its operations until the file is back online. We suggest you to use different anchor file names if you merge multiple remote mounts together with a tool such as UnionFS or MergerFS . Each remote mount MUST have its own anchor file and its own name for that anchor file. In addition, make sure to define the 'merged' path to the file and not the remote mount path. This helps check whether the union-software is working correctly as well. Minimum age \u00b6 Autoscan does not check whether scan requests received by triggers exist on the file system. Therefore, to make sure a file exists before it reaches the targets, you should set a minimum age. The minimum age delays the scan from being send to the targets after it has been added to the queue by a trigger. The default minimum age is set at 10 minutes to prevent common synchronisation issues. Customising the processor \u00b6 The processor allows you to set the minimum age of a Scan. In addition, you can also define a list of anchor files. A snippet of the config.yml file: # override the minimum age to 30 minutes: minimum-age : 30m # override the delay between processed scans: # defaults to 5 seconds scan-delay : 15s # override the interval scan stats are displayed: # defaults to 1 hour / 0s to disable scan-stats : 1m # set multiple anchor files anchors : - /mnt/unionfs/drive1.anchor - /mnt/unionfs/drive2.anchor The minimum-age , scan-delay and scan-stats fields should be given a string in the following format: 1s if the min-age should be set at 1 second. 5m if the min-age should be set at 5 minutes. 1m30s if the min-age should be set at 1 minute and 30 seconds. 1h if the min-age should be set at 1 hour. Please do not forget the s , m or h suffix, otherwise the time unit defaults to nanoseconds. Scan stats will print the following information at a configured interval: Scans processed Scans remaining Targets \u00b6 While collecting Scans is fun and all, they need to have a final destination. Targets are these final destinations and are given Scans from the processor, one batch at a time. Autoscan currently supports the following targets: Plex Emby Jellyfin Autoscan Plex \u00b6 Autoscan replaces Plex's default behaviour of updating the Plex library automatically. Therefore, it is advised to turn off Plex's Update my library automatically feature. You can setup one or multiple Plex targets in the config: targets : plex : - url : https://plex.domain.tld # URL of your Plex server token : XXXX # Plex API Token rewrite : - from : /mnt/unionfs/Media/ # local file system to : /data/ # path accessible by the Plex docker container (if applicable) There are a couple of things to take note of in the config: URL. The URL can link to the docker container directly, the localhost or a reverse proxy sitting in front of Plex. Token. We need a Plex API Token to make requests on your behalf. This article should help you out. Rewrite. If Plex is not running on the host OS, but in a Docker container (or Autoscan is running in a Docker container), then you need to rewrite paths accordingly. Check out our rewriting section for more info. Emby \u00b6 While Emby provides much better behaviour out of the box than Plex, it still might be useful to use Autoscan for even better performance. You can setup one or multiple Emby targets in the config: targets : emby : - url : https://emby.domain.tld # URL of your Emby server token : XXXX # Emby API Token rewrite : - from : /mnt/unionfs/Media/ # local file system to : /data/ # path accessible by the Emby docker container (if applicable) URL.

Jellyfin \u00b6 While Jellyfin provides much better behaviour out of the box than Plex, it still might be useful to use Autoscan for even better performance. You can setup one or multiple Jellyfin targets in the config: targets : jellyfin : - url : https://jellyfin.domain.tld # URL of your Jellyfin server token : XXXX # Jellyfin API Token rewrite : - from : /mnt/unionfs/Media/ # local file system to : /data/ # path accessible by the Jellyfin docker container (if applicable) URL.

When an anchor file is unavailable, the processor will halt its operations until the file is back online. We suggest you to use different anchor file names if you merge multiple remote mounts together with a tool such as UnionFS or MergerFS .

How it works \u00b6 FlareSolverr starts a proxy server and it waits for user requests in an idle state using few resources. When some request arrives, it uses puppeteer with the stealth plugin to create a headless browser (Chrome). It opens the URL with user parameters and waits until the Cloudflare challenge is solved (or timeout).

This allows for getting recent uploads (like RSS) and performing searches. Jackett is a single repository of maintained indexer scraping & translation logic - removing the burden from other apps.

If you are able to help out please contact us . Please see our troubleshooting and contributing guidelines before submitting any issues or pull requests Jackett works as a proxy server: it translates queries from apps ( Sonarr , Radarr , SickRage , CouchPotato , Mylar , Lidarr , DuckieTV , qBittorrent , Nefarious etc.) into tracker-site-specific http queries, parses the html response, then sends results back to the requesting software. This allows for getting recent uploads (like RSS) and performing searches. Jackett is a single repository of maintained indexer scraping & translation logic - removing the burden from other apps. Developer note: The software implements the Torznab (with hybrid nZEDb / Newznab category numbering ) and TorrentPotato APIs. A third-party Golang SDK for Jackett is available from webtor-io/go-jackett Supported Public Trackers - 1337x - 7torrents - ACG.RIP - ACGsou (36DM) - Anidex - AniLibria - AnimeClipse - Animedia - Anime Tosho -

This should make things easier for those who are not as comfortable in the commandline or just prefer a ui. I have also removed a couple of the config elements, namely, the PLEXPATH and MOUNTEDPATH options. These are now handled directly by the application and Docker. When you pass through you plex media directory, the app will automatically map this and find your plex path to make the config easier. Now as long as the container has write access to the media directory, it should make enabling the backup posters much easier. There is an option to automatically migrate your old config files into the new ui for easier migration. New HDR banners along with a script to migrate from the old banners to the new ones should you wish to use them. You can stick with the old banners if you would like. The new scripts us TheMoviedb for finidng posters and metadata, so for maximum compatability and fewer issues, these work best when using TheMoviedb as your metadata agent. Throughout my testing, it is only sequals that were giving me issues, as the Plex scanner will name your films like: Boss Baby 2: Family Business Whereas on TheMoviedb it is named: Boss Baby: Family Business This means that the search for the film can fail in the script. New Features: \u00b6 GUI for managing the application in a browser Add 4k mini banners to your 4K TV episodes. New HDR banner design Dolby Vision HDR Banner HDR10 Banner Migration scripts for moving from the old config files to the new database and for moving from the old HDR banner to the new designs. Features \u00b6 4K/HDR Posters \u00b6 This script will go through your library and add a 4k banner to your posters. Configurable options include: Selecting full width banners or mini corner banners enabling HDR banners Backup your original posters alongside your media This can be run on both your films library and your TV shows Library. If enabled on your TV shows, a mini 4K banner will be added to each of your 4K epiisodes, not the season posters. This is due to the possibility of having Shows/Seasons with mixed resolutions. TV shows will be done at the same time as film posters. 3D Posters \u00b6 Much like the 4K poster script, this will go through your films and add a 3D banner to your films. Currently as Plex has no support for labelling content as 3D this will only work for 3D films kept in a separate library. You can configure the script to have full width banners or the mini corner banners as well as backing up your posters. Available Banners \u00b6 The 4K/3D banners will be combined with the HDR posters if they are enabled. \u00b6 Hide 4K \u00b6 For those of you who don't separate your 4K and non-4K content into separate libraries. This script will go through your films library and add an \"Untranscodable\" tag to any of your films that only have a single 4K copy of the film available. By adding this tag to your users restrictions, they simply won't see these 4K films giving your hardware a break. If your hardware is powerful enough, there is the option to create an optimized version so that your users can play this version. This will send your film to be optimized with the Plex optimize feature baked directly into Plex. This means all the hardwork is done by your plex server, (useful if you're hosting these scripts on a lower powered device.) Once the transcode has finished, the untranscodable tag will be removed the next time the script runs and your users will be able to see the film.

Before you start: \u00b6 We strongly recommend restoring your Server on a VPS or something similar before making the final migration. This is to avoid data-loss and to harden your backups for your final dockserver migration. This guide will take you through a migration with Teamdrive deployed on your pg installation. Feel free to experiement with the gdsa builder in the CLI. Prerequisites: \u00b6 PGblitz Tdrive/Tcrypt mount deployed CloudCMD deployed (Under Community Apps) Open CloudCMD, Navigate to: /appdata/plexguide/.blitzkeys Download the contents of that folder (rclone.conf and GDSA keys) to your local machine. These files are very important. Handle with care. On some forks of PG these files are placed under /uploader and /mount. Now you are ready to backup your PG apps. sudo wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dockserver/dockserver/master/backup.sh | sudo bash This will create a folder named /appbackups on the root of your remote drive. When the backup is done, check that these files exist on your remote drive. Also, check them for file sizes to make sure it looks right. Plex can take a long time, be patient. Now, please order a VPS with ubuntu 18/20 on it and follow the instructions on the frontpage . When dockserver is installed on your host, return here and follow instructions Mount & Uploader \u00b6 Open a terminal Create the folders sudo mkdir -p /opt/appdata/system/{rclone,servicekeys} sudo chown -cR 1000:1000 /opt/appdata Install CloudCMD (under addons) Navigate to /opt/appdata/system/rclone Upload the rclone.conf from your old server. Do not rename this one. Navigate to /opt/appdata/system/servicekeys Upload the the same rclone.conf to this folder. Rename this rclone.conf to rclonegdsa.conf Navigate to /opt/appdata/system/servicekeys/keys Upload all service keys (GDSA01,02..) Rename all service keys to not containing a 0 so GDSA01 becomes GDSA1 and so forth.. Edit your rclone.conf sudo nano /opt/appdata/system/rclone/rclone.conf Remove all GDSA lines here, only the remotes(g/tdrive, g/tcrypt) are left in the file - PGUNION has to be deleted as well Like this: [gdrive] client_id = XOXOYOURID client_secret = XOXOYOURSECRET type = drive server_side_across_configs = true token = XOXOYOURTOKEN [tdrive] client_id = XOXOYOURID client_secret = XOXOYOURSECRET type = drive server_side_across_configs = true token = XOXOYOURTOKEN team_drive = XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX [tdrive2] client_id = XOXOYOURID client_secret = XOXOYOURSECRET type = drive server_side_across_configs = true token = XOXOYOURTOKEN team_drive = XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX CTRX+X press y Edit rclonegdsa.conf sudo nano /opt/appdata/system/servicekeys/rclonegdsa.conf Remove all the remotes (g/tdrive, g/tcrypt) - PGUNION has to be deleted as well. You'll also want to make sure to update the service_account_file line. Remove the previous path and change it to /system/servicekeys/keys/ like below. Again, remove all zeroes so that the values will be displayed like this: [GDSA1] type = drive scope = drive service_account_file = /system/servicekeys/keys/GDSA1 team_drive = XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX [GDSA2] type = drive scope = drive service_account_file = /system/servicekeys/keys/GDSA2 team_drive = XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX CTRL+X y Done. Now you can deploy mount & uploader under in the system section in the CLI After this you are ready to restore your PG apps on a brand new Dockserver installation Note: \u00b6 Google Token Expire it may possible that your Google token expires after a server reboot/migration or other things logs can be checked with this: sudo tail -n 50 -f /opt/appdata/system/mount/logs/rclone-union.log And you can also check if remotes are displaying something: sudo docker exec mount ls -1p /mnt/unionfs if you see something like: Token Expired or could not authenticate with google then this is your solution (only do a token refresh): sudo docker stop mount sudo fusermount -uzq /mnt/unionfs sudo fusermount -uzq /mnt/remotes cd /opt/appdata/system/rclone You can install rclone using the following command: sudo apt install curl jq && sudo curl https://rclone.org/install.sh | sudo bash After installing Rclone, verify the Rclone version with the following command: sudo rclone --version Then reconnect: rclone config reconnect tdrive: --config=rclone.conf rclone config reconnect gdrive: --config=rclone.conf Then start mount again: sudo fusermount -uzq /mnt/unionfs sudo docker start mount sudo docker logs -f mount ( or use dozzle for the logs reading ) Support \u00b6 Kindly report any issues/broken-parts/bugs on github or discord Join our","title":"Migration"},{"location":"install/migration.html#introduction","text":"While many of us has enjoyed PGblitz over the years, the project is now scattered.
